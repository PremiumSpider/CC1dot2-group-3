              <p>Turtles are reptiles that have a protective shell and can retract their head and limbs into it. They

                <p>Crocodiles are large, heavily armored reptiles with long snouts and powerful jaws capable of
                  delivering a deadly bite. They are found throughout the tropics and can thrive in fresh or salt water

                  <p>Chameleons are a distinctive family of climbing lizards known for their ability to change color and
                    the extraordinary speed and range of their long tongues, used to capture prey like insects and small
                    vertebrates. Found in warm habitats ranging from rainforests to deserts, most chameleons have
                    prehensile tails, feet suited to grasping branches, and eyes that can rotate independently.</p>

                      Pogona. It has spiny scales around its throat that when puffed up resemble a beard, and can change
                      color from light to dark to regulate body temperature or show mood.</p>
