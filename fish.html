      <img src="Images/fish/clownfish.png" />
      <span class="info-bubble">"Hi there! I'm a clownfish, famously known for my bright orange color and white stripes. I have a special relationship with sea anemones - they protect me from predators, and in return, I help keep them clean!"</span>

      <img src="Images/fish/great-white.png" />
      <span class="info-bubble">Greetings! I'm the great white shark, often misunderstood. I'm an important part of the ocean's ecosystem, helping to keep fish populations healthy. Remember, I'm more interested in seals than humans!</span>

      <img src="Images/fish/octopus.png" />
      <span class="info-bubble">"Hello! With eight arms and lots of smarts, I'm an octopus. I can change color and texture to blend into my surroundings and I'm known to be quite the escape artist!"</span>

      <img src="Images/fish/manta.png" />
      <span class="info-bubble">"Good day! I'm a manta ray, easily recognized by my large size and graceful movements. I filter plankton out of the water to eat as I glide through the sea."</span>

    <div class="creature" id="eel">
      <img src="Images/fish/eel.png" />
      <span class="info-bubble">"Hi! I'm the Electric Eel, the spark of the Amazon. I generate electricity to find my way and catch my prey in murky waters. Charged up and ready to explore, I play a shocking role in my riverine ecosystem!"</span>

    <div class="creature" id="coelacanth">
      <img src="Images/fish/coelacanth.png" />
      <span class="info-bubble">"Hey there! I'm the Coelacanth, the 'old soul' of the sea. You can call me a swimming time capsule from dinosaur times. I've got funky fins and a tough hide, and I've been around since way before the T-Rex!"</span>
